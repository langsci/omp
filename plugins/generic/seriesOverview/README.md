Series Overview Plugin for OMP

Description:

This plugin lists all series and all books in each series (using accordions). The order of the series is determined by the number of books in the series. You can use (cover) images if you want to. 

In the settings you can specify

1) The path of the page.

2) Whether to use images or not. The images are displayed in the accordion content area next to the book list and as list style type for the series. Put the images in the "img" folder, name them after the path of the series, e.g. "seriesNumber1.png".
